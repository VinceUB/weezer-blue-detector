This software is PROPRIETARY. You may use this software ONLY to check whether an image contains the Weezer Blue colour. You MAY NOT modify my code to check for ANY OTHER COLOUR. You may ESPECIALLY NOT modify my code to change the spellings to something incorrect (including americanisms). 
If you're GitHub, I give you that license that you asked for in the terms of service or whatever, BUT I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT. This technically means that you're allowed to fork it (and maybe modify it? I'm not a lawyer, but if the ToS doesn't say it, you don't get to do it) on github, but you're gonna have to do the entire thing through github, NO DOWNLOADING AND DOING IT ELSEWHERE.
